Predicting Orbital Elements Machine Learning Project 
By: Sriya Darabala

Goals:
The goal of this project is to take live position and velocity component data from satellites 
to predict certain orbital metrics such as the Right Ascension of Ascending Node (RAAN), 
argument of perigee (AoP), and inclination which would then be used to make predictions about 
an orbital trajectory.
